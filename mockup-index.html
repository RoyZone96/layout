        <h2>Profile</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">I am a full stack web developer and artist who excels at creating logos and labels designed for music. I enjoy coding
					because it's like a puzzle game. When presented with a particularly challenging code, I can sit at a computer for hours
					until I solve the puzzle. When not coding I enjoy swimming fishing traveling and gaming. Even with all I have learned
					so far I still consider myself inexperienced and am open to learning more and improving my skills.

        <h2>World War 2 Quiz Command</h2>
          <p class="summary">
            My latest project is based on my favorite time in history: World War II. In this project, I want the user to envision themselves as a commander of their own squadron. On the battlefield, knowledge is just as big a factor in winning a battle as to how powerful the weapons you wield or how many men you command. With every correct answer you give, the safety of one of your men is guaranteed. On the other hand, ignorance of important information can easily lead to your men getting killed. With World War II: Quiz Command, you can put your knowledge to the test.
